## Description

Javascript-based quiz application that dynamically populates questions and answers in the html, and draws from as well as stores values through localStorage API and DOM manipulations. Allows timed assessment with timing dynamically set and configurable within the appliclation javascript, and gamified challenge aspects including time penalties for incorrect answers and persistent scoreboard ranking. The application has potential for elearning module interruptive assessments and checkpoints, allowing users to take a mid-module quiz to self-checks how well they can recall rote and fast-recall concepts on a given topic, including the potential for gamification aspect of knowledge-check comparison against peers via a arcade-ish scoreboard. The application features also include dynamically updated HTML and CSS (driven by classic JavaScript - no jQuery selection, methods, or shorthand; no additional js libraries leveraged). The interface is clean, polished, adaptable via standard Bootstrap 4.5.0 classes, and responsive.
