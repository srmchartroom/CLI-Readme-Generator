# CLI-Readme-Generator &nbsp; ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Node.js-blue) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-ES6-red)

## Description

The application package is node.js-based command-line interface (CLI) application that leverages the _inquirer_ package and _fs_ package among others. The application takes user input from command-line prompts, and outputs a preformatted and best-practice-based README.md for projects, repositories, and applications. This application is most beneficial to developers and individuals who use platforms such as GitHub or GitLab to store, source control, share, and collaborate upon applications.
